                        ATTCAT: The Annotation and Translation of Traditional Chinese Architecture Terminology Annual Research Forum
                    </h2>
                    <p>The thesaurus and dictionary of Chinese architectural terminology on Architectura Sinica is currently being enhanced through the ATTCAT project. Participants in this international, multi-university research forum seek to annotate, translate, and illustrate historical terms used in describing and building traditional structures in China. Sponsored by Southeast University, Nanjing, and initiated by scholars working at Southeast University and Vanderbilt, ATTCAT participants from universities in China, Japan, the US, Germany, and Austria gather for annual workshops to discuss research on particular terms and collate parallel terms in Chinese and other languages (primarily English, but also Japanese and German). After revision, the fully annotated research notes are published on Architectura Sinica. Brief versions of select notes are also available on the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT).</p>
