            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt id="selection">Why does the Gazetteer include these (names / descriptions / bibliographies / names / etc.) and omit others which are perhaps more significant?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> creates a framework to allow the progressive growth of geographic information about places relevant to Syriac Studies,
                        and is not intended to be a comprehensive summary of all the information (or the most important information) about each of these places.  In light of
                        limited initial time and resources, we adopted a "breadth-first" rather than a "depth-first" approach, consulting reference works which listed large numbers
                        of places for the purpose of creating placeholders for as many places as possible.  This enables <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> to give search results for
                        more obscure places than any previous Syriac geographical reference work.  The names, descriptions, events, and bibliographic entries for the initial 
                        release were derived exclusively from the reference works we consulted for a large number of places and from whatever additional works the editors
                        were consulting at that time, but they are not to be taken as the final word.  Instead, their presence demonstrates the framework which enables future
                        users to add additional data points with citations.  If there is a particular fact missing which you would like added, it can be.</dd>
                <dt id="settlement">Is the term "settlement" too vague, or perhaps too small, to describe major cities as well as tiny villages?</dt>
                <dd>There are two reasons <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> has adopted the place type "settlement" as a catch-all rather than distinguishing between
                            various sizes of settlements, large and small.  First, "settlement" already has a substantial usage among digital geography projects (for examples,
                            <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/vocabularies/place-types/settlement">Pleiades</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement">Dbpedia.org</a>).
                            <a href="http://darmc.harvard.edu">The Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations</a> uses the category "Cities and Settlements" without
                            distinguishing between subcategories, which is effectively the same solution.  By adopting the category of "settlement" we are more easily
                            interoperable with those other projects.  Second, and particularly important when dealing with <em>historical</em> geography, population centers 
                            change over time, and what was once a small village may now be a major city and vice versa.  Because place types are exclusive, were <i>The
                            Syriac Gazetteer</i> to adopt size-differentiated types of settlement (e.g. metropolis, city, town, village, hamlet), then it would need to create distinct
                        place records for the same place whenever it grew into a larger category or shrunk into a smaller category.  Creating non-controversial ways to
                        differentiate among these place types over two millennia would be a challenge matched only by our inability in almost every case to adduce evidence
                        for precisely when a settlement crossed over the boundaries of these size-differentiated place types.  It has been deemed sufficient and preferable,
                        therefore, to retain a larger category of "settlement" without attempting to subdivide it.</dd>
