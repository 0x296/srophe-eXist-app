                        <h2>Architectura Sinica</h2>
                        <p>Architectura Sinica is, at its core, a digital image archive of the monumental architecture of pre-modern China. The dataset is focused on our earliest extant examples of timber-frame architecture in China, largely dating from the 8th-13th centuries, and includes information on construction techniques as well as stylistic features. The vast majority of these buildings were constructed for ritual purposes, therefore data on style and structure of the buildings, as well as epigraphic information on site concerning patronage, have the potential to enhance not only our understanding of the aesthetics of traditional Chinese architecture over time and space, but also our understanding of the trade networks, crafts traditions, and spiritual aspirations of people living in pre-modern China.</p> 
                        <p>Currently in active development, Architectura Sinica is designed to be a be a public, browser-based architectural history research website. When complete the site will consist of four parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A linked open data (LOD) database of architectural complexes and individual structures searchable both by name of site (ancient and modern) and by technical terminology used to describe individual elements of single timber-frame buildings that are known to vary across regions. Search terms will be in Chinese (traditional and simplified scripts), pinyin Romanization of modern Mandarin, and English translation.</li>
                            <li>A digital mapping tool that will allow search results to be located on a map of modern China using public domain base maps. This will be linked to the photo archive to facilitate viewing of search results through the map interface. Map output will be available in digital and analog forms for peer-reviewed publication.</li>
                            <li>A encyclopedic dictionary and thesaurus of technical terminology used to describe Traditional Chinese Architecture. Most entries are the product of the ATTCAT (The Annotation and Translation of Traditional Chinese Architecture Terminology) Project, an international team of students and scholars who meet annually to research individual architecture terms and collate previous translations. ATTCAT workshops are generously sponsored by Southeast University School of Architecture in Nanjing 南京東南大學建築學院.</li>
                            <li>Photographs and transcriptions of epigraphic information found at a given site. Titles of stele inscriptions and donor names will be searchable using traditional Chinese characters.</li>
